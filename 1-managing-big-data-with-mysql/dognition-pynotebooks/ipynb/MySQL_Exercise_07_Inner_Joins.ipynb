    "Recall that tables in relational databases are linked through primary keys and sometimes other fields that are common to multiple tables (as is the case with our Dognition data set).  Our goal when we execute a JOIN or make a joined table is to use those common columns to let the database figure out which rows in one table match up to which rows in another table.  Once that mapping is established using at least one common field or column, the database can pull any columns you want out of the mapped, or joined, tables and output the matched data to one common table.\n",

    "To illustrate how this works, let's find out whether dog owners that are particularly surprised by their dog's performance on Dognition tests tend to own similar breeds (or breed types, or breed groups) of dogs.  There are many ways to address this question, but let's start by focusing on the dog owners who provided at least 10 ratings for one or more of their dogs in the ratings table. Of these owners, which 200 owners reported the highest average amount of surprise at their dog's performance, and what was the breed, breed_type, and breed_group of each of these owner's dog?\n",
    "\n",
    "The surprise ratings are stored in the reviews table.  The dog breed information is provided in the dogs table.  There are two columns that are common to both tables: user_guid and dog_guid. How do we use the common columns to combine information from the two tables? \n",

    "To join the tables, you can use a WHERE clause and add a couple of details to the FROM clause so that the database knows from what table each field in your SELECT clause comes.  \n",

In this syntax, the alias is whatever word (or phrase, if you use quotation marks) follows immediately after the field or table name, separated by a space. Some people find it easier to read queries if you use the syntax without an AS to create table aliases, but retain the syntax with an AS to create field aliases (but both syntaxes work for field aliases and table aliases).

Further, the query as written does not tell the database how the two tables are related.  As a consequence, rather than match up the two tables according to the values in the user_id and/or dog_id column, the database will do the only thing it knows how to do which is output every single combination of the records in the dogs table with the records in the reviews table.  In other words, every single row of the dogs table will get paired with every single row of the reviews table.  This is known as a Cartesian product.  Not only will it be a heavy burden on the database to output a table that has the full length of one table multiplied times the full length of another (and frustrating to you, because the query would take a very long time to run), the output would be close to useless.\n",
