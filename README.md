# online-courses
This repo contains some of the resources of the online courses that I took recently. This is to help me remember the things that I learned. Maybe these resources will also be useful to you.

* From Coursera:

    1 - Managing Big Data with MySQL by Duke University

    2 - Advanced Deployment Scenarios with TensorFlow by deeplearning.ai
